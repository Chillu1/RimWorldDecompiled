# RimWorldDecompiled

Decompiled source code (dlls) of simulation game RimWorld (only personal use allowed)

I don't own any part of the code in this repo. Almost all rights go to Ludeon Studios.

This code has a lot of licenses, of which some are listed under Licenses.txt.
Some parts of the code are from third parties, and are listed under their own licenses.

But most of the code is under full copyright by Ludeon Studios.

RimWorld's [EULA](https://rimworldgame.com/eula/) allows you to decompile the game for personal use.
