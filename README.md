# RimWorldDecompiled
Decompiled source code (dlls) of simulation game RimWorld (only personal use allowed)

I don't know any part of the code in this repo. Almost all rights go to Ludeon Studios. 
This code has a lot of licenses, of which some are listed under Licenses.txt. 
But most of the code is under full copyright by Ludeon Studios.
